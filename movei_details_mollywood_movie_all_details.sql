Moments after running away from the scene in a ramshackle van, Raju stars narrating his life days before the incident. After coming to Hyderabad with Prabhas Seenu, Raju fell in love with Amulya (Surbhi), the future fiance of Kesava Reddy (played by Harish Uttaman). His hatred towards dogs makes him impulsively hand over Amulya\'s puppy to dog cullers and this threatens to lead to their break-up. It is now up to Raju to trace that dog and in the process, he faces obstacles from a whole range of funny characters and Kesava Reddy, the one major character with no comic side. The director of \'Venkatadri Express\' fame has done a fairly good job in telling and executing a not-so-novel idea with doses of fun. The first half establishes the incident and the second half is more about delineating the dog-stealing incident more elaborately through occasional revisiting. Besides it is also about Sapthagiri, Urvashi, Shakalaka Shankar, Supreet, Dhanraj and Supreet doing their bit to add to the comedy of errors and confusion. Raju and Amulya continue to achieve success in their mission slowly and steadily, and it all ends with the hero, hitherto regarded as an irresponsible son by his father, becoming a real-life hero. In so far as writing a screenplay that doesn\'t complicate matters for the audience, this film steals a march. More than the curious turns in Raju\'s life, the idiocy of characters keeps the entertainment quotient up. Sapthagiri makes it a laugh riot in every scene he is seen. Prabhas Seenu complements his efforts. Urvashi is one talented yesteryear actress who has the potential to re-invent herself through well-written roles like it was the case in Size Zero. In this film, she is quite watchable both as a power-hungry mother of a villainous son and someone who loses her memory and turns into Vasantha Kokila\'s Sridevi. As character after character turns out to have a stake in the dog, the audience looks forward to a routine denouement. The climax doesn\'t have the scale or imagination to be worthy of being talked about. It would have been interesting if the hero was shown to have actively worked towards preventing the dog from falling into the hands of Supreet or Harish Uttaman, revealing what he did to ensure that in the climax. By showing Dhanraj as instrumental in making Sharwa a hero, the climax was robbed of excitement, although a smile on the face is certain.',150,'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDZkMDQ1OGYtMWJiZi00OTEzLTk2YjMtOGUxZjg5NmE0YjNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDEzODQ4MDE@.jpg',2016,'Action, Comedy, Romance','Telugu','Merlapaka Gandhi','Merlapaka Gandhi, Merlapaka Gandhi, Sheik Dawood G., Merlapaka Gandhi','V.

Although Sharath and his daughter Keerthi get along well with Siva, his wife considers him a financial burden. Siva befriends a group of students and falls in love with Asha, sister of the honest police inspector Venkat. The college\'s (unopposed) student-union president, J. Durga Rao (known as J. D.) is the lowest rung in a gang ladder reaching through the gangster Ganesh to Bhavani, a crime boss. Bhavani uses the network to support his mentor Machiraju, a politician. Although J. D. is arrested many times, Bhavani continues to bail him out. When J. D. teases Asha on campus, Siva attacks him with a bicycle chain; a rivalry then develops between him and Ganesh. The incident encourages Siva\'s friends to ask him to stand for the student-union presidency, but he wants them to nominate Naresh (one of the group) instead. Ganesh\'s attempts to pacify Siva fail, and Bhavani learns about him. He considers Siva a potential replacement for J. D., whose weakness annoys him. Naresh is fatally assaulted by J. D. and Bhavani\'s henchmen, and is taken to hospital. Siva retaliates, infuriating Bhavani. When Siva\'s friends attend a wedding, they are attacked by Ganesh and others. One of Siva\'s friends, Malli, is murdered and Siva swears revenge. Sensing a risk to Sharath\'s family after an attempt on Keerthi\'s life, Siva leaves their house and moves into his friend Chinna\'s hostel. He agrees to contest the student-union presidential election. Bhavani cheats labour-union leader Krishna Reddy, who changes his allegiance to Siva. Around this time, Asha and Siva marry. Bhavani begins attacking and murdering Siva\'s close aides, and Siva ensures that Sharath relocates to Visakhapatnam as a part of his job. Siva attacks Bhavani\'s henchmen, and helps Venkat arrest Ganesh. Machiraju sees Siva as a potential replacement for Bhavani, and stops supporting the latter. Bhavani learns about Siva\'s relationship to Sharath, and kidnaps Keerthi. Ganesh appears in court, and an arrest warrant is issued for Bhavani.

Babu becomes lonely and homesick especially when he sees his classmates getting letters from their parents and when they come to meet them. Babu is made to believe by the old servant that his mother is in \'vaikuntam\' (heaven). Babu sends letters to his mother addressed as \"Mother, Vaikuntam\". The letters are entrusted to the gardener Gopalan Nair (Muthukulam Raghavan Pillai) to be mailed. Gopalan Nair\'s daughter Sarala (Ambika Sukumaran) happens to see the letters. She takes pity on the child and replies to the letters as if sent by his mother whom he believes is in heaven. Through these letters, Sarala and Babu become close to each other. Once, Babu gets injured while playing. Sarala who meets the child for the first time nurses him until his wounds are healed. Babu believes that Sarala is his mother who has come from the heaven to nurse him and Sarala does not correct him. Mohan returns. He marries Sarala so that Babu may not lose her. Sarala gives birth to Indira (Baby Vinodini). She dotes on both as her own children. Gopalan Nair does not approve of his daughter\'s fondness for Babu. He reveals the truth to the boy. Babu is upset; he begins to feel that Sarala does not care for him. He runs away from home with Indira. Mohan and Sarala, with the help of the police, begin their search for the children. Babu and Indira are found on the top of a multi-storeyed building. In a risky rescue operation by the police the children are rescued. Babu comes to realise that though his mother is dead Sarala loves and cares for him. This was the first Malayalam film of Kamal Haasan - he played Sathyan\'s son.

Sunil tries to get Radha killed by breaking a bottle on her head. But she is saved and she recovers from her mental illness. But she doesn\'t remember anything about the incident. The inspector (Janardhanan) smells something fishy and suspects Sunil. After a few days Varma\'s sister (Sreevidya) is shot dead and the police suspects Sunil. Is Sunil the murderer?

Even Stavros being friends with an Armenian was frowned upon. As such, Stavros dreamed of a better life - specifically in America - where, as a result, he could make his parents proud by his grand accomplishments. Instead, his parents, with most of their money, sent Stavros to Constantinople to help fund the carpet shop owned by his first cousin once removed. What Stavros encountered on his journey, made on foot with a small donkey, made him question life in Anatolia even further. Once in Constantinople, his resolve to earn the 110 Turkish pound third class fare to the United States became stronger than ever. But try after try, his efforts were thwarted. But as he seemed close to achieving his dream, it seemed certain that it would snatched away from him.

This disaster was caused by nearly two and a half decades of endosulfan use on government-owned cashew plantations. The film explores the disastrous environmental and public health consequences of the pesticide misuse. It also concentrates on those health-related effects of endosulfan misuse, that persist to this day. The film depicts the after-effects of the pesticide spraying through the eyes of a photographer. His first visit to the area was during a rainy season in 2001, and his photographs revealed the shocking state of the numerous victims to the world. Endosulfan-induced misery gained worldwide attention due to this exposure. When the photographer visited the area again in summer 2006, many of the young victims he had photographed during his earlier visit, had been dead. Even now, children are being affected with strange and debilitating diseases. In 2011, the Stockholm Summit of UN on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP) recommended a total ban on endosulfan. India was the only country that opposed this decision. A year later, in 2012, the photographer returned to Kasaragod. He realized that apathy and indifference to the plight of these unfortunate victims persisted, and that the survivors continued to suffer.',116,'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTNkZTMwYzItMzA3Zi00MWQ4LWE4YzQtNzc4NzM4ZDc3MDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE5NzE3OTE@.jpg',2015,'Drama','English, French, Malayalam','Bijukumar Damodaran','Bijukumar Damodaran','Pillai A.K',NULL,'M.J.

Stealing a small and hardly seaworthy fishing boat, 14-year-old Mulla flees the sleepy, idyllic island of Lakshadweep for the crowded bustle of Mumbai. Akbar, Mulla\'s elder brother, left for the city some years before, and Mulla - with only a phone number to rely on - is convinced the two can reunite there. But upon arrival, Mulla immediately falls in with a gang of criminal orphans, receiving a crash course in survival skills for Mumbai\'s criminal underground. In the midst of Mulla\'s story, Mohandas takes us back to the days leading up to Akbar\'s departure from Lakshadweep, when he met mute Ameer sent to the island for an unwanted arranged marriage. Their gay affection will alter the course of both of their lives. Alternating between scenes of bracing violence and heartbreaking tenderness, The Elder One is an epic story of familial bonds and underworld misadventure, infused with urgent questions regarding gender, sexuality, and tolerance.
