- To understand the design and flow of the code, I have explained the code design in this page [Code design](https://github.com/Naveen-S6/Entertainers_Data_Analysis/tree/main/src_code)
- The beauty of designing a code is, you can use them for other data as well, I have populated some extra data for Indian industry entertainers, which I didn't use it in this project. You can find the sql dump in this page [SQL dump](https://github.com/Naveen-S6/Entertainers_Data_Analysis/tree/main/Populated_Data/Indian%20Entertainers%20dataset)
