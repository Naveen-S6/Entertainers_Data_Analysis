Once, a masked Walter breaks into Police Constable Baby\'s (Janani Iyer) house, but she recognizes the man and thwarts his attempt to rob them.

Actor Surya comes to the village for a fund-raising meeting and Highness asks the actor to watch Walter\'s performance before he leaves. At first, Walter\'s antics draw laughter and ridicule from the crowd, but soon they begin to appreciate the honesty of his emotions and Surya shows his appreciation by hugging Walter and wishing him a great future. This incident changes Saamy\'s opinion of Walter and in an inebriated state he confesses to Highness that he actually likes Walter and that any ill-feelings he has had are totally misplaced. The brothers unite and this makes both Highness and the two mothers happy. Meanwhile, Arya brings Thenmozhi home and tells Higness that he wants to marry her.

Rocky\'s friends advise him to love and marry a well educated girl so that his name will be added with her name after marriage i.e., indirectly he gets a degree after his name. So, earnestly he looks around by hovering around women\'s colleges to find a perfect girl for his mission. He finally succeeds in his attempt and makes Gayathri (Tamannaah Bhatia), a well-educated rich girl fall for him. He starts to honestly love her and takes her for shopping to a mall where she is confronted by a group of rogues who work for Rami Reddy (Sayaji Shinde) who is a rival of Samarasimha Reddy (Suman). Her father is Samarasimha Reddy (Suman) a notorious don in Andhra who protects his daughter Gayathri by destroying the gang and takes back Gayathri to Andhra Pradesh. The protagonist goes to Assault Arumugam (Vivek), a thug-for-hire, to help him marry his love interest.
