However, when her friend tells her how much Ramesh actually loves her, she is finally convinced. Ramesh had actually bought Priya a grain of rice with her name written on it. Priya thus realises she also loves Ramesh and begins trying to get him to accept her. However, he refuses to accept her as he believes she thinks he is of lower-class. In a subplot, Ramesh witnesses a murder committed by the local gangster Ravi ( Prasanna ). In shock, Ramesh runs away, and eventually trips over an elderly man. The next day, Ravi sends Ramesh to Gujarat as he fears for his safety. A few days later, the deceased\'s son appears in the Commissioner\'s office with the elderly man, who claims he can identify the boy who ran into him. Apparently, the deceased is an ex-MLA, and the Commissioner decides to deal with the matter himself. The Inspector warns Ravi and his gang, implying to them that the witness should be killed. Meanwhile, Priya receives a call from her mother telling her that her father is going for surgery and asks her to return to the US. Priya tells Ramesh that she will be waiting at the bus stop the next day, at the same place where they first met. If he loves her, he would come. The next day, eventually being coaxed by Kumar, Ramesh goes to see her. On the way, Ravi tries to kill him, but his conscience gets the better of him. However, he also knows there is another goon in the same bus as Priya waiting to kill Ramesh. Ramesh manages to stand in front of Priya, and they hold hands for a while. Ramesh then slips off the steps and is run over by the bus. His mother, friends and Priya mourn his death while the goon who was supposed to kill him slips away. The movie ends with Priya in a car, looking at the grain of rice that has her name on it which Ramesh presented to her for her birthday.',146,'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTJiODNjYjMtZmQxNC00Zjk0LTgyMjUtNGUzMmJiYzJjMjMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODk1MzE5NDA@.jpg',2010,'Romance','Tamil','Badri Venkatesh','L.K.','Thyagarajan','Yuvan Shankar Raja','Richard M.

He appears distracted throughout the day and even instructs his assistant to postpone an important meeting with a big client. He then waits for someone at Marina Beach with a bouquet of flowers. His best friend, Lakshmi sees him and asks him whom he is waiting for. Gilli explains he is waiting to meet his girlfriend, Arati (Rakul Preet Singh) for their date. In flashbacks, we are shown how Gilli first met Arati. Gilli belongs to a lower middle class family, living with his parents and younger sister in Rainbow Colony in Chennai. He is perceived as a good for nothing person as he skips classes, fails in exams, and gets involved in fights. Gilli believes that his father hates him and often quarrels with him, even threatening to leave the house, only to be persuaded not to do so by his mother. Gilli\'s life changes when a once well-to-do family moves into the same colony due to loss in business. Gilli is attracted to the daughter of his new neighbour, Arati. Although he tries to woo her, Arati treats him with disdain. One day, Gilli confesses to Arati that he loves her. He tells her that having always been ridiculed, he found respite in the fact that she at least bothered to look at him. He promises to wipe her thoughts out of his mind, as he is not right for her. Despite himself, Gilli continues pursuing her. Arati realizes that Gilli is not such a useless fellow when Lakshmi tells her that she has seen Gilli dismantle and assemble a motorcycle within minutes each time they steal a bike to get drunk. Arati takes Gilli to a Hero Honda dealer and asks them to give him a job. He is promised a job if he can assemble a bike. Initially, the lethargic Gilli is disinterested and gives up the task. Arati takes him to the washroom and slaps him before revealing that she has fallen in love with him. She then tells him that they can only be together if he gets a proper job and gets his life straightened out. Gilli then demonstrates his skill in motorcycle assembly, securing a good job with the dealer. Later that evening, Gilli plans a treat for his friends. However, Arati confronts him and makes him break the good news to his parents first to get their blessings. However, Gilli\'s father berates him as usual for getting a job instead of completing college. Then later at night, Gilli overhears his father telling his mother how proud he is of their son since getting a job at such a prestigious company, which is not easy. The only reason the father did not openly praise Gilli is because he feared his son might misjudge him for giving him respect, only now that he is earning money for their household. Only then does Gilli realize his father\'s love for him and weeps in joy. The intimacy between Gilli and Arati is discovered by her mother and she refuses to allow them to continue dating even as Gilli\'s father tries to persuade her otherwise. Arati\'s family is heavily indebted to another Northern Indian family that has been supporting them since Arati\'s father suffered losses in his business. Arati\'s parents want Arati to marry the son of the family that has helped them. Using her friend\'s marriage as a ruse and with unwitting help of her friend\'s aunt, Arati escapes her home and travels with Gilli to a tourist place near Thekkady in Kerala and they end up in a hotel room. Arati reveals that she has made the biggest decision of her life by deciding to make love to him, as he should not regret falling in love with her when she marries the man her parents chose. Though stunned by her decision, Gilli goes with her plan and the two consummate their love. The next morning Gilli and Arati argue when Gilli says he wants Arati to live with him, while Arati accuses him of being attracted to her only because of the sex. They continue arguing as they exit the hotel. While crossing the road, Arati is knocked down by a truck as a helpless Gilli watches. Gilli is also hit by a speeding vehicle. Arati dies gruesomely on the spot and Gilli is injured. Gilli is heavily shocked to find the mere remains of Arati in Hospital mortuary. Though the Police want to file a murder case on Gilli, Arati\'s mother refuses to name Gilli as a murderer. Gilli tells the Police that Arati never accepted his love, and her death was really an accident. This way, Gilli saves Arati\'s dignity and her mother blesses him as she leaves. After sadly returning to Chennai, Gilli tries to commit suicide only to be helped by a group of nuns. Gilli then hallucinates about Arati\'s spirit coming to him and advising him to live life to the fullest. Back in present day, it is revealed that Gilli has become very successful person in his life but has remained mentally damaged since Arati\'s death. He still believes that she is alive and always imagines talking to her. The film ends with Gilli talking to himself at the beach, thinking that he is talking to Arati.',NULL,'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQ3ZDM2MDQtMDc5Yy00N2FkLWFiNWItZGI0ZjNhMjZjNzZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEzNzg0Mjkx.jpg',2009,'Drama','Kannada','Raghava Loki','Ram Narayan','Anaji Nagaraj','Yuvan Shankar Raja',NULL,NULL),('Rashna: The Ray of Light ()',NULL,NULL,NULL,'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjA0NTJiZDUtMmVmMy00NGMwLWE2ODItYmRmOTQ1NDAyZTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODQxMDYwMDU@.jpg',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),('NBK 107 ()',NULL,NULL,NULL,'https://m.media-amazon.png',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),('Untitled Chiranjeevi Film ()',NULL,NULL,NULL,'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTE2ZjA5YWUtNTVmMi00NjE1LThjMjQtNDI2ZDdlNTEzOTU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk3NDMwOTc@.jpg',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),('Salaar',NULL,'A gang leader tries to keep a promise made to his dying friend and takes on the other criminal gangs.',NULL,'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ3MzhlNzQtZGEyOC00OWI2LWI5NDAtNTlmMTUwMGI3ODM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTgxODY5ODI@.jpg',2023,'Action, Thriller','Telugu, Kannada, Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam','Prashanth Neel','Prashanth Neel','Vijay Kiragandur, K.V.

Siva befriends a group of students and falls in love with Asha, sister of the honest police inspector Venkat. The college\'s (unopposed) student-union president, J. Durga Rao (known as J. D.) is the lowest rung in a gang ladder reaching through the gangster Ganesh to Bhavani, a crime boss. Bhavani uses the network to support his mentor Machiraju, a politician. Although J. D. is arrested many times, Bhavani continues to bail him out. When J. D. teases Asha on campus, Siva attacks him with a bicycle chain; a rivalry then develops between him and Ganesh. The incident encourages Siva\'s friends to ask him to stand for the student-union presidency, but he wants them to nominate Naresh (one of the group) instead. Ganesh\'s attempts to pacify Siva fail, and Bhavani learns about him. He considers Siva a potential replacement for J. D., whose weakness annoys him. Naresh is fatally assaulted by J.

Nandini\'s three brothers throw a feast in honor of the girl child. The young son of the local singer (who had died) is brought in to sing for the event. The three brothers raise Nandini like their own child as their parents had died. At the age of 5, an astrologer predicts that Nandini will bring much happiness to the family, but her marriage will based on her choice and not the choice of her brothers. This angers the brothers and to prevent this from happening, she is raised within the confines of the house. She is home schooled and when she does go out, all the men are warned to hide from Nandini and that seeing Nandini will be met with dire consequences. Raja Nandini (Karisma Kapoor) reaches puberty. The few males allowed around her are the service staff and her bodyguards. Meanwhile, the boy who sang, Rama (Venkatesh) grows up to be a naive and gullible simpleton with a heart of gold. He is raised by his widowed mother Savitri (Raakhee Gulzar). He doesn\'t go to school and spends his time singing and entertaining the people of the village. One day the bodyguards get into a fight with Rama who beats them up. Impressed with Rama\'s naivety and fighting skills, the brothers hire Rama to be Nandini\'s bodyguard and butler. Nandini meanwhile starts to resent her lack of freedom. She engages Rama to show her the village without her brothers knowledge. Rama complies with her wishes and shows her the village which results in Nandini getting sick. Rama is blamed for Nandini getting sick and gets beaten up by the brothers. Nandini who has just started to like Rama feels guilty for being the reason for him getting trashed. This incident brings them closer together emotionally. Nandini realizes she is now in love with Rama. One day, a factory worker is punished for leering at Nandini. He plots to kill Nandini at the inauguration of the new factory owned by her brothers. Rama overhears the plot, and in a desperate attempt to save Nandini lunges on her and inadvertently feels her up in public. Nandini doest mind and defends Rama by arguing that Rama wouldn\'t do something like that in public. But her brothers are enraged.They beat him to the point that they almost kill him. Nandini stops them and gives him a chance to explain. When Rama explains the situation they hang their heads in shame. Rama quits his job on the spot, despite Nandini\'s silent apology. That night Nandini decides to meet Rama and apologize and perhaps convince him to come back to the job. Rama refuses to comeback as he doesn\'t want to put up with the violent nature of her brothers. She thinks if Rama marries her, they won\'t be able to manhandle Rama. She convinces Rama to tie a wedding chain (Mangalsutra) around her neck which will protect him from her brothers. Rama without realizing the sanctity of the act does as told and doesn\'t realize he is now married to her. Rama comes back to work and is given a higher level of respect by the brothers for saving Nandinis life. Nandini too starts emulating her sisters-in-law in taking care of her husband. This makes Rama nervous but he still remains clueless, her change in behavior is noticed by her sister-in-law who urge the brothers to get Nandini married off before the situation gets any worse. Nandini realizing that they are trying to get her married off tries to make Rama understand that they are already married. Rama refuses to understand and runs away to his mother who upon realizing what has happened pulls him out of denial. She sends him away in an attempt to protect him. The brothers come to know whats happened and try to torture the mother to get her to reveal where her son is hiding. She is saved in time by her son who almost kills the brothers.

The wedding between Radha and Shamu (Raaj Kumar) was paid for by Radha\'s mother-in-law, who got a loan from the moneylender Sukhilala. This event starts the spiral of poverty and hardship that Radha endures. The conditions of the loan are disputed, but the village elders decide in favor of the moneylender, after which Shamu and Radha are forced to pay three-quarters of their crop as interest on the loan of 500 rupees. While trying to use more of their land to alleviate their poverty, Shamu\'s arms are crushed by a boulder. He is shamed by his helplessness and is humiliated by others in the village. Deciding that he is no use to his family, he leaves and does not return. Soon after this, Radha\'s mother-in-law dies. Radha continues to work in the fields with her children and gives birth again. Sukhilala offers to help alleviate her poverty in return for Radha marrying him, but she refuses to sell herself. A storm sweeps through the village that destroys the harvest and kills Radha\'s youngest child, and the villagers start to migrate but decide to stay and rebuild because of Radha\'s urging. The film then skips forward several years to when Radha\'s two surviving children, Birju (Sunil Dutt) and Ramu (Rajendra Kumar), are young men. Birju, embittered by the exactions of Sukhilala since he was a child, takes out his frustrations by pestering the village girls, especially Sukhilala\'s daughter. Ramu, by contrast, has a calmer temper and is married soon after. He becomes a father ,but his wife is soon absorbed into the cycle of poverty. Birju\'s anger finally becomes dangerous and, after being provoked, attacks Sukhilala and his daughter and violently lashes out at his family. He is chased out of the village and becomes a bandit. On the day of the wedding of Sukhilala\'s daughter, Birju returns to exact vengeance. He kills Sukhilala and takes his daughter--but Radha, who had promised that Birju would not do harm, shoots Birju, who dies in her arms.

Raju and Amulya continue to achieve success in their mission slowly and steadily, and it all ends with the hero, hitherto regarded as an irresponsible son by his father, becoming a real-life hero. In so far as writing a screenplay that doesn\'t complicate matters for the audience, this film steals a march. More than the curious turns in Raju\'s life, the idiocy of characters keeps the entertainment quotient up. Sapthagiri makes it a laugh riot in every scene he is seen. Prabhas Seenu complements his efforts. Urvashi is one talented yesteryear actress who has the potential to re-invent herself through well-written roles like it was the case in Size Zero. In this film, she is quite watchable both as a power-hungry mother of a villainous son and someone who loses her memory and turns into Vasantha Kokila\'s Sridevi. As character after character turns out to have a stake in the dog, the audience looks forward to a routine denouement. The climax doesn\'t have the scale or imagination to be worthy of being talked about. It would have been interesting if the hero was shown to have actively worked towards preventing the dog from falling into the hands of Supreet or Harish Uttaman, revealing what he did to ensure that in the climax. By showing Dhanraj as instrumental in making Sharwa a hero, the climax was robbed of excitement, although a smile on the face is certain.',150,'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDZkMDQ1OGYtMWJiZi00OTEzLTk2YjMtOGUxZjg5NmE0YjNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDEzODQ4MDE@.jpg',2016,'Action, Comedy, Romance','Telugu','Merlapaka Gandhi','Merlapaka Gandhi, Merlapaka Gandhi, Sheik Dawood G., Merlapaka Gandhi','V.
