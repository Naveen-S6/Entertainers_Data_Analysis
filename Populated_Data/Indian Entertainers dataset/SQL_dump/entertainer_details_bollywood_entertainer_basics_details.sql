Unfortunately I have very little. But Salman [Khan] has it all.','Aamir Khan was born on March 14, 1965 in Mumbai. He is one of the most successful Indian Bollywood actors who is also known as \"Mr. Perfectionist of Bollywood\". With his recent successes in both the Indian and Chinese film markets, he has shouldered his way into becoming one of the world\'s biggest superstars. Undergoing rapid transformations in his body structure to better embody the variegated characters in his energetic films, Aamir has garnered praise from all parts of the globe. His most visible transformations can be seen in such movies as Lagaan (2001), Fanaa (2006), Taare Zameen Par (2007), Ghajini (2008), 3 idiots (2009), Talaash (2012), Dhoom 3 (2013), PK (2014), Dangal (2016) and Secret Superstar (2017). His recent successes with movies like Dangal, PK , Talaash and TV serial Satyamev Jayate have attracted attention from more serious moviegoing crowds. However, he is perhaps better known for his fabulous comedic roles, as exemplified by his iconic performances in cult comedies such as Andaz Apna Apna, Passion, and Dil Chahta Hai, to name a few. Aamir is also no slouch at TV commercial work.2001\'s Lagaan released in China nationwide, beginning what would be a series of Aamir Khan films that would firmly plant Indian filmmaking into the minds of Chinese audiences. 3 Idiots became a cult hit in China farther along in the 2000\'s, followed by Like Stars on Earth and Ghajini, both of which went on to gain huge followings. Aamir Khan\'s streak of Chinese box office hits continued into and throughout the 2010\'s with the rapid-fire release of Dhoom 3 (2013), PK (2014), Dangal (2016) and Secret Superstar (2017).Aamir was first introduced as a child artist in the 1970\'s hit Procession of Memories (1973) - he was the youngest child in the trio.His performance in Earth (1999) as the Ice-Candy man has received rave reviews from Indian and international critics. Using classic \"method acting\" and an adopted technique inspired by his seniors Sanjeev Kumar, Rajesh Khanna, Dev Anand and Shammi Kapoor, Aamir acts in all genres of Indian films - comedy, action, drama and romance. He is regarded as a complete Indian actor of the post 1990 generation of actors for his diverse choice of roles and films. In 2007 he turned director with the film Like Stars on Earth (2007), which not only brought him immense critical acclaim but was also a huge box office success. Many of his films are considered as cult classics like Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India (2001), Dil Chahta Hai (2001), Color It Yellow (2006), Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar (1992) and Andaz Apna Apna (1994). He divorced his first wife Reena Dutta on December 09, 2001 and married Kiran Rao in December 28, 2005 and divorced her on July 03, 2021.In 2008 his first all out commercial action film Ghajini (2008) went on to become the highest grossing film of its time in Indian Cinema and 4th highest inflation adjusted, grossing a total of Rs.226 on the worldwide box office and the first film to cross 100 crores on the domestic Indian box office, making a total of Rs.115 crores. This record didn\'t last long, though, since his next release 3 Idiots (2009) went on to shatter not only the highest grosser record but many more. It not only made the highest opening first day, first weekend and first week records but subsequently continued to shatter many records on the following weekends and weeks, making many circuits on the way. It made a total of Rs.202 crores domestically and Rs.400 crores on the worldwide box office, becoming the highest overseas grosser to date, a staggering feat given that no other film had even come close to making Rs.100 crores on the domestic box office until then, except for his own Ghajini (2008) the previous year.Aamir is said to be the actor who first started the trend of actors working in one film at a time, when the others worked in four or five at the same time. He is also known to shun popular film trade magazine awards like Filmfare, Star Screen, etc. as he doesn\'t have trust in their credibility and transparency. Recently he was awarded the third highest civilian honor Padama Bhushan by the government of India.Aamir\'s expansive range of characterizations remains unparalleled amongst his contemporaries. Because of this diversity and his formidable ability to portray different characters believably on screen, he is today regarded not only as one of the biggest stars in Bollywood but also as one of the finest actors in all of Indian Cinema.::apmisy1325@hotmail.com and Liam Wilhelm','Short, yet muscular stature, Frequently collaborates with Rajkumar Hirani, His movies often mock traditional Indian values and Hindu religious beliefs., Frequently makes controversial statements before the release of his films.','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwMjk3NDUzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI4MTY0NA@@.jpg'),('Aditi Rao Hydari','1986-10-28','5\' 1¾\" (1.57 m)',NULL,NULL,'Aditi Rao Hydari was born in 1986 in Hyderabad, from two royal lineages, that of Sir Akbar Hydari and J.
