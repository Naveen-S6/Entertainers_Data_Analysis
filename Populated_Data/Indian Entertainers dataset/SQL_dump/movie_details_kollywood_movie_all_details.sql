He rescues her, but the rioters later come to his house, and brutally rape and then kill his wife.

He meets up with Sriram Abhiyankar, who is leading a group of Hindu extremists, and Saketh becomes temporarily taken with the cause himself. At the same time, he is persuaded to take a new wife, Mythili, and life begins to stabilize for Saketh after all. However he then falls in with an eminent Maharajah who is leading an underground group with the intention of assassination. Travelling with the Maharajah, Saketh meets one of his old friends from younger days, who has fallen on hard times. Reminiscing, and getting his old friend back on his feet deflect the process of recruiting Saketh, but only temporarily, and soon he is manipulated into committing himself to renouncing his family and his new wife, in the interests of the cause which now is disclosed as the assassination of Gandhi.

Chidambaram receives a complaint from some of the local merchants that the British Shipping Company had refused to load their goods. Against great odds, Chidambaram starts the National Shipping Company with Indian Capital to free Indian trade from dependence on foreign liners. The company prospers despite attempts by the British Company to sabotage the ship of the Indian firm.

Nagarajan',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),('Jesus',6,'Jesus dreams of a medieval battle in the name of Jesus Christ and of a dying world war soldier who, in desperation, calls out the name: Jesus. Jesus awakes, distraught. What is the meaning of this nightmare? Why are these strangers using his name? Jesus is a simple carpenter, like his father Joseph. Both are presently looking for work, but they\'ve been wandering for days from town to town without finding any. Times are difficult in Galilee. Roman taxes are stifling the country. The hated Jewish tax collectors, viewed by the people as traitors, rob people of their last means of subsistence. Revolts and bands of revolutionary thieves are spreading uncertainty throughout the land. Herod Antipas, the Jewish king, is merely a weak shadow of his feared father Herod the Great. The real power lies in the hands of Caiphas, the high priest. To strengthen his position, he plays the Jewish interests against the Roman interests with religious fervor. His most dangerous opponent is the new Roman procurator, Pontius Pilate. This hard, people despising military man has an ideal comrade in arms in the cynical author and spy Livius. The two callously attempt to keep rebellious Judea under Roman control. Countless crosses with executed rebels line the streets. The Romans, however, observe the growing power of itinerant preachers and prophets with suspicion. The most influential of these prophets is John the Baptist. He fearlessly condemns Roman lust for power, the decay of religious customs and the reprehensible immorality in the house of Herod. After Joseph\'s death, Jesus feels abandoned and lonely. He believes that he is not yet strong enough to take up his calling. Then his mother Mary tells him how an angel once revealed to her that she would bear a son, and she tells how determinedly Joseph declared his support for this miraculous child, despite the fact that it was not his own. Further, Mary describes the foreign kings who paid homage to the newborn child. Jesus now realizes that it is time for him to follow his calling. He takes his leave from his previous life and from Mary of Bethany, the woman who loves him. From now on, his life is to be completely devoted to his great mission. Jesus visits John the Baptist. In their childhood days, Joseph raised these two as brothers. They remember their first shared visit to the temple, as well as the fact that, back then, it was Jesus who, as a 12 year old boy, went to the temple without his parents\' knowledge, in order to teach in his father\'s house. Now that Jesus is ready to take up his calling, John agrees to baptize him. At the baptism, a glowing dove appears and a voice calls Jesus by name. After the baptism, Jesus retreats to the desert, alone, to meditate. There, Satan appears to him in the form of a beautiful, beguiling woman and a man in contemporary street clothes. Satan shows Jesus all the unhappiness that his teachings will one day bring to humanity and offers him in exchange real, unlimited power over the Earth. Jesus resists the temptation and, now steadfast, returns home. The first disciples are already slowly beginning to gather around Jesus. They still have doubts, however, as to whether their master is really the heralded Messiah. Only Mary trusts in her son. When the wine runs out at her nephew Benjamin\'s wedding, she is able to talk Jesus into giving everyone a visible sign of his divine heritage. Jesus asks to have the amphora filled with water and transforms it into wine. This miracle allays his disciples\' doubts. Through miracles, Jesus succeeds in allaying the doubts of Simon the Fisher and even those of Thomas, the skeptic. They, too, follow him. At the same time, however, Jesus continually perplexes his followers with his incomprehensible behavior. He shuns the Jewish freedom movement lead by the wild Zealot leader Barnabas, for example, and instead accepts the invitation of Matthew the tax collector. Matthew, too, becomes a follower of Jesus, despite the other disciples\' mistrust. When a recently discovered adulteress is to be stoned by an angry mob, Caiphas sees his chance expose to Jesus. He invites the crowd to demand a verdict from Jesus. Jesus, however saves the desperate young woman by declaring that only he who is without sin himself may cast the first stone at her. Ashamed, the mob disperses. Deeply moved by this scene, the former prostitute Mary Magdalene joins the disciples. When Jesus wants to go with his students to the temple to pray, he finds the temple court full of traders and money changers. Suddenly overcome with rage, Jesus hurls their stands to the ground and, wielding a whip, drives the profiteers out of the temple. When neither the Jews nor the Romans show signs of resistance, it becomes clear that Jesus will play an important role in Judea\'s future religious and political development. John the Baptist, in the meantime, has been executed at the wish of Queen Herodias, the wife of Herod Antipas. Jesus mourns his loss greatly, but he can hardly give in to his pain, as more and more people are coming to him to hear his teachings, even though many of these still seem strange and incomprehensible. For example, Jesus preaches that God favors the meek, the poor and the faint. Above all, however, he doesn\'t put strict observance of the laws first, but rather love of one\'s fellow man. Jesus doesn\'t even shun non-Jews, to his disciples\' dismay. All attempts by the ambitious disciple Judas to give Jesus\' teachings a political twist fail. Judas is forever trying in vain to gain Jesus\' support for the Zealots\' freedom fight. Finally, when Jesus brings Lazarus, who is dead and has already been lying in his grave for several days, back to life in front of several onlookers, his popularity knows no bounds. Sitting on a donkey, Jesus rides into Jerusalem and is received like a king by an enormous crowd. Caiphas sees a real threat to his religious authority. He goes to Pilate, who, in fact, officially wants to have nothing to do with Jewish religious matters, but secretly has already planned Jesus\' death, together with scheming Livius. He was just waiting for Caiphas to take the initiative. This way, Pilate can pretend that he is merely carrying out the will of the Jewish authorities and does not have to take any personal responsibility for Jesus\' death. Jesus himself knows quite well that his death is inevitable. At a last shared supper, he bids his disciples farewell. He tells Judas, however, that he should listen to his conscience for a change. Judas has long been contemplating delivering Jesus to the authorities in order to provoke a rebellion and thus to force Jesus to take political action. He leaves the meal to betray Jesus\' location to Caiphas\' henchmen. Jesus spends his last hours of freedom with select disciples in a garden near Jerusalem. Again Satan appears to him and tries to talk Jesus into avoiding his death. He tries to convince Jesus that, not only will his death be meaningless, but quite the contrary: it will bring that much more suffering and atrocity into the world. He shows him religious wars and witches being burned. But Jesus believes in the love in people and surrenders to Judas, who is approaching with Caiphas\' henchmen. While Jesus is being sent back and forth between Caiphas, Pilate and Herod in a cruel farce, being brutally whipped all the while, his disciples hide in fear. Even courageous Simon, who Jesus once called Peter, the rock, denies knowing his master. Jesus is sentenced to death. Undergoing dreadful torture, he is crucified on a hill near the city. When he dies, the sky becomes dark and an earthquake rocks the land. The disciples take him down from the cross and bury him in a cave. Three days later, however, they find the cave empty. Jesus, alive, appears to them and commands them to proclaim everywhere that love has conquered death. Even doubtful Thomas has to believe the miracle when he is allowed to touch the crucifix wounds on Jesus\' hands.',240,'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWNhYWIzNmQtN2ZhYy00NmU3LTg0ODctNzdiYTAyZjZkZjBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzMwOTY2NTI@.jpg',1999,'Biography, Drama, History','English',NULL,'Suzette Couture',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),('Bheema Mera Haathi',4.1,NULL,NULL,NULL,1973,'Drama','Hindi',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),('Malai Nattu Mangai',NULL,'Malai Nattu Mangai is a 1973 Indian Tamil film, directed by P.

An angry Ilanthiraiyan takes the matter to court. In court, Thennavan provides uncontested evidence and the culprits including Ilanthiraiyan are sentenced to life imprisonment. Divya eventually marries her lover Thennavan. With Ilanthiraiyan in jail, his naive wife Pushpalatha (Urvasi) replaces him as the new chief minister and bails him out of jail. Thennavan is then arrested but Pushpalatha makes him release due to public pressure. After a small quarrel with her husband, Pushpalatha resigns from her function and her government is dismissed by the governor. With the election campaign going on full swing, Thennavan resigns from his position. He then holds a public meet: he urges the voters to boycott the election to save the country from corrupt politicians and to stop people who will try to vote. The day of the election, not a single vote has been cast and it is well received by the public. The prime minister praises Thennavan for his achievement and accepts to pass the five laws.',146,'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODEzYjVlZTgtZWViMC00N2QzLTg1ZmMtYjY0NzAwYTcyNjFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEzNzg0Mjkx.jpg',2003,'Drama','Tamil','A.M.

Its hard hitting message screams at you from the screen, loud and clear. Hitherto, there seemed to be only a couple of angles to Child labour in India, viz., children losing out on their carefree childhood and basic formal education. But there are so many other unthought of issues too, says scriptwriter and director Poomani, through the film Karuvelam Pookkal, jointly produced by NFDC and Doordarshan. Karisalkulam, a small village, is inhabited mainly by Farmers. When the arid land offers them nothing but penury, enter the match factory owners from nearby villages. They lure the credulous, illiterate villagers into sending their daughters to work at the factories from dawn to much after dusk. The initial euphoria of a steady income givesway to despair, as is clearly brought out through the story of Nallamuthu (Nasser), his wife Vadivu (Radhika) and their three children. Mariyappan (Charle) is the Match factory agent in charge of finding child labourers for the factory. While the children slog in the factories the men of the household become lazy appendages who spend their time getting drunk. Nasser, as the cynical father, who does not wish to get his daughter married because he does not want to forgo the income, has rendered a splendid performance in Karuvelam Pookal. Mention must be made of the scenes in which he cries aloud at his tragedies and when his impotent anger is turned towards the agents of the match factories. Radhika\'s is another sterling portrayal. In the role of a responsible mother caught between her husband\'s apathy and avarice and her children\'s untold suffering, she indeed lives the character. Sonia is the eldest daughter, Dhanalakshmi. Caught in the quagmire of drudgery and in the strangulating web of poverty, she seeks a way out, but sadly the respite is too short lived. A convincing essay by the young Actress. The visuals of the opening sequences transport you to the days of Bharatiraja\'s movie 16 Vayadhinilae. The beautifully captured rustic ambience is another creditable show by Thangar Bachan who has wielded the camera. The dialect, the innocent humour, the openness and the gullibility - Poomani presents them all with absolute vividness. The factories need only young girls and the boys therefore escape the hardship. After stressing on this point throughout, it is strange to see the boy accompany his sister to work, in the end. The fragrance of Karuvelam Pookkal is bound to last in the minds of the discerning audience.

Even though the good (tortoise) may win in the end, is it worth the wait? It is based on S.G. Sathye\'s Marathi play Sasa Aani Kasav (Hare and Tortoise). The tortoise - Rajaram P. Joshi (Naseeruddin Shah) - is a middle-class clerk living in a chawl (middle-class apartment complex) in Bombay. He is secretly in love with his neighbor, Sandhya Sabnis (Deepti Naval), but is unable to disclose his love for her, mainly due to his timidity. Rajaram is a very good natured and hardworking man. Most of his neighbors and colleagues take advantage of his goodness. One day Rajaram\'s fast-talking friend Vasudev alias Bashu (Farooq Shaikh) - the hare - comes for a visit and makes himself at home. Bashu generally impresses people by his false success stories and his over-the-top attitude. Bashu starts wooing Sandhya, and she falls in love with him. He then joins Rajaram\'s company, Footprint Shoes, by impressing the owner, Mr. Dhindhoria, with false stories about his work experience and love of golf. He also starts flirting with Dhindhoria\'s beautiful wife Anuradha (Mallika Sarabhai) and daughter Jojo (Winnie Paranjape) at the same time. In the chawl, the Sabnis family decides to get Sandhya married to Bashu, much to the shock of Rajaram. But on the day of the engagement, Bashu disappears after being caught red-handed, romancing Anuradha, by Jojo. The engagement is called off. Rajaram then offers to marry the devastated Sandhya, but she tells him that she has been very intimate with Bashu and is perhaps pregnant. Rajaram shows his greatness by accepting her in spite of all this and expressing his long hidden love towards her.',141,'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTIzYjc1N2QtNjVmZi00MTgzLWJiN2UtZWJjYmMxNGVmNWIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@.jpg',1983,'Comedy, Drama','Hindi','Sai Paranjape',NULL,'Suresh Jindal','Raj Kamal','Virendra Saini',NULL),('Mathiya Chennai',4.3,NULL,NULL,'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWExYThjMjQtZDAzYy00YzMzLWJhYmMtZTZlMjI0YmI4MDIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM5NDY4NzU@.jpg',2009,'Drama','Tamil','Veerasingam, Vivekanand',NULL,NULL,'Ilaiyaraaja','K.

The Caliph sends to Charlemagne an ambassador who brings with him an elephant as a gift. Considering the animal to be a symbol of force, and thus a threat, Charlemagne decides to respond by sending emissaries back to the Caliph. The Emperor entrusts his imperial cross, encrusted with an enormous ruby, to a monk, a man of letters little inclined to action, father Seraphim. In this way, Charlemagne aims to display his force and wealth to Rachid Pacha and, in so doing, to maintain the balance of power between the two empires. At the end of a long voyage, Charlemagne\'s emissaries, accompanied by the Caliph\'s ambassadors, make a final halt in an oasis where they are killed by a gang of thieves. Charlemagne\'s cross is stolen but Father Seraphim is miraculously spared by the thieves as is young Morgiane, the magician Al Miradjan\'s daughter. This young woman will be bought at a slave market by Cassim, Ali Baba\'s greedy and vain brother. The 40 thieves are in fact under the orders of the great vizier, or minister, Yaya, and of Caliph\'s repudiated wife, Zubayda, who have secretly organized the massacre of the ambassadors in the hopes of sparking a diplomatic crisis and forcing Rachid Pacha to declare war on Charlemagne. With Rachid Pacha gone off to fight, Zubayda could take over the power. Discovering the treasure in the cave, Ali Baba cannot resist the temptation of grabbing Charlemagne\'s cross. His fateful encounter with History is sealed. From that point on, Ali Baba will struggle with a host of problems : how to keep his discovery secret, how to escape the wrathful vengeance of Malik, the leader of the thieves, how to settle the arrangements for the marriage of his oldest son, Slimane, who, in the meantime, has fallen in love with the beautiful Morgiane, and no longer wants to marry his father\'s choice, and, finally, how to get his wife to live in peace with his sister-in-law, Ouria who has been widowed when the 40 thieves caught her husband, Cassim, in their cave and cut him up in little pieces. The plot thickens even more for Ali Baba when he invites Father Seraphim into his home and learns the reasons for the monk\'s coming to Baghdad. The West must combine forces with the East in order to foil the plans of the infamous Yaya and of the terrifying Zubayda, to save the beautiful Morgiane who has been kidnapped by the Vizier and to reach the unapproachable Caliph and reveal the villainous plot to him and give him back Charlemagne\'s cross.

They get seats next to each other and introduce themselves to one another. As a coincidence, they get to know that all 3 of them have passed the UPSC exams with high ranks, and are going to Delhi for phase-4 of their Civil Service training and become friends. During the course of the training, Surya loves Priya, whereas Prakash lusts after her. While Surya\'s dad Manivannan and Priya\'s family visit the trio in Agra, Prakash reveals to Priya\'s mom about his desire to marry Priya. At the same time, Surya\'s dad asks Surya to marry Priya. During the last days of training, Priya also falls in love with Surya. During the results of Phase 4, Priya gets selected as cadre-I IAS officer, while Prakash misses the cut-off and becomes Cadre-II IPS officer, because he had spent 2 minutes of the final exam thinking about Priya. At the same time, Surya\'s results are held back by the UPSC board, because of an FIR in Surya\'s name. 3 years earlier, Surya was a village farmer. During harvest, the local tasildar refused to pay the farmer\'s demand and started to forcefully take their cane crop to government stores at a cheaper price. Surya protested against this, and he hits the tasildar as the tasildar hit his father. Surya is arrested and placed in police custody. The villages continue their protest at the police station, prompting the District Collector Lakshmi IAS to come to the station the next day. She studies the situation, and causes the government to pass a GO in favor of the farmer\'s demands. While she asks the police to release Surya after knowing that he is a post-graduate, they refuse, as an FIR has been filed on him, and Surya must be presented before a magistrate. Shocked by this development, the Collector, in her right as District Magistrate cancels the FIR and lets Surya go free. This power of an IAS officer led to Surya taking up the UPSC exams. After Surya\'s explanation, UPSC agrees to let him go, but holds his result pending an inquiry. Surya and Priya then visit Lakshmi IAS, who is now deputy-Home secretary in Chennai, asking her help. After that they propose to one another, and start their one-month vacation. Surya refuses to go to his village, as he had promised that he will return only as an IAS officer. So he visits Priya\'s family in Ooty. Priya\'s mom and sister happily accept Surya as prospective groom for Priya. After a month, Priya leaves for her job as Assistant Collector in Chennai. While all goes well, it is revealed that months ago, a rich newspaper owner son Arun has tries to harass Priya\'s sister Pavithra during her way to school and Pavi had him imprisoned for that. Arun, in an act of vengeance, blocks Pavi\'s public exam number in all newspapers on the result day. Due to power failure, no news of results reaches Priya on the correct time, and Priya\'s mother assumes that she has failed her exam due to playfulness. Hurt, Pavi commits suicide. During her funeral, news agencies come to reveal that Pavi had come as first rank in the state. Adhi and his friend also come to the funeral. Adhi\'s friend reveals Adhi\'s misdeeds to the public and Surya pushes Adhi against a tree, in a fit of rage. Adhi gets a head injury and dies. Surya is arrested on murder charges and sent to Chennai prison for remand. At the same time, Prakash joins as an IPS officer, and begins his duty in Chennai Jail. It is revealed that Prakash is to serve for 24 hours to fulfill his father\'s wishes and then resign to enjoy his life as a billionaire. At the same time, Surya is brought to Prakash\'s jail. Prakash is initially shocked at Surya\'s state, but decided to use it to his advantage. He cancels his resignation plans and makes multiple attempts as Surya\'s life through the inmates. He also asks Surya to convince Priya to marry him. Surya agrees, and Prakash takes him out on Parole to meet Priya. There, Surya reveals that he knows that Prakash informed the UPSC about his FIR incident, and Surya will not give up Priya. This makes Prakash even angrier. Days later, Prakash receives telegram that Surya\'s dad is dead, but he refuses to let Surya go for the funeral. Surya is aided by a constable Alex, and he escapes via a tunnel. It turns out that Alex is on the payroll of Prakash. Within minutes of Surya\'s escape, Alex is killed by Prakash, and he frames Surya for that murder. He conspires with Arun\'s father to publish headlines that Surya has been shot dead for the murder of Alex. Surya is received by an impostor at the end of the tunnel, and realises the folly. Surya comes back to the jail by daybreak, beats Prakash black and blue, and reseals himself in his cell. The arriving officers realised Prakash\'s crimes and arrest him.

Once, a masked Walter breaks into Police Constable Baby\'s (Janani Iyer) house, but she recognizes the man and thwarts his attempt to rob them.

Velli (Reema Sen) is the \'head mermaid\' at this stall run by her sister, and bitter quarrels between Shakti and Velli ensue, when Shakti feels that Velli and her team are unfairly taking their customers away and Velli has this impression of Shakti being an unsavoury character. This misunderstanding is seen at different occasions where Velli and Madhavan just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time - be it when Shakti gets off the bus from his village, asks for directions and is told to follow Velli, walking in the distance (Velli thinks he\'s a womaniser) or when Shakti finally catches up with a miscreant who had picked his pocket and demands his money backâ€\"only Velli walks into the scene only at the demanding part.

Manivannan plays the character of the owner of the exhibition grounds and keeps harassing Velli under some pretext or the other, like the rent not being paid on time.

Rajapandi asks Pandi to go to a marriage ceremony. While on the train, he met Bhuvana (Sneha), a cop\'s daughter in the other village, and after a sequence of events, romance blossoms between them. One afternoon, Bhuvana gives all the money she has on her person to Pandi and convinces him to take her out to lunch at a restaurant. After eating his lunch, he went outside to wash his hands and saw his sister and her boyfriend having a conversation. Pandi chases the motorbike on an auto, leaving Bhuvana stuck with the bill and no money, having given it all to Pandi. When Pandi eventually catches up with the boyfriend, the boyfriend tells him that they are seriously in love, and he is going to be coming over to their place with his parents to ask for her hand in marriage. Everything was going well until a couple days later, Sundarapandi wanted the money to buy the jewelry. Pandi\'s family receives a shock as Sivagami cannot find the money that they have saved up to pay for the wedding. Since Pandi is already a known troublemaker and has been to jail already, Sundarapandi blames Pandi and kicks him out of the house. This happens in front of Bhuvana, who has come to see where he has been the last few days and why he ran away at the restaurant. This incident with Sundarapandi accusing Pandi of taking the money has convinced her that he took her money the other day and ran and also just using her. In the end, it turns out that Rajapandi has run away from the house with his lover and with the money. Sundarapandi is consoled by Pandi, who borrows money from a private money lender and completes the wedding. Meanwhile, Pandi tries to make amends with Bhuvana, but she will not hear any of it. Sundarapandi, seeing the argument, went over and told Bhuvana the truth and how he misjudged his son and that is was not him that took the money. The following day, Sundarapandi went to Bhuvana\'s house to ask her father Periyamaayan (Ilavarasu) to fix a marriage between Pandi and Bhuvana. Periyamaayan, upon hearing this, gets furious. He is the local police inspector and knows all about Pandi\'s past. He refuses to marry his daughter to a criminal. Periyamaayan arranges a marriage for Bhuvana, but she went to Sundarapandi to say that she will die before marrying another person than Pandi. Pandi snatched Bhuvana from her house, takes her to the police station, and asks her father to approve of their marriage.

When Ramakrishnan questions the leader Sivarasan (Mansoor Ali Khan), he remains silent. Another LTTE member (Rajesh) who was not caught phones Subha Sundaram to release his fellows. Ramakrishnan releases them and they proceed to Sri Lanka. Divya parks her car in a no parking area and refuses to move the car. When asked by a traffic constable, she shows Ramakrishnan\'s visiting car. Arun orders to seize the car and also tears up the visiting card when Divya shows it. Divya complains to Ramakrishnan and asks him to get the car and an apology from Arun. Ramakrishnan convinces Arun to give her car back. Then Ramakrishnan and Divya get married. One day in a meeting, the DGP (M. N. Nambiar) informs that the state govt may be dismissed, so they have to tighten security in Chennai since ruling party supporters may indulge in violence.

Sivarasan exchanges suitcase of gold biscuits for money. Sivarasan then goes to Subha Sundaram\'s house to find the photographer. Then Subha introduces Hari babu to Sivarasan.

The DGP informs that Rajiv Gandhi (Anupam Kher) will arrive in Sriperumbudur for an election rally and they must guard him since he is under threat of terrorists. Sivarasan and other LTTE members assemble and plan to kill Rajiv Gandhi during the election rally. They then conduct a mock drill of the assassination and prepare a belt bomb. Rajiv Gandhi arrives and gives his answers on Ramjanmabhoomi and the Sri Lankan issue to reporters at a press meet. He then garlands Indira Gandhi\'s statue and arrives at the venue. Dhanu sneaks in as a person to garland Rajiv Gandhi. Arun doesn\'t allow her since she is not on the list. When Rajiv Gandhi arrives, he lets Dhanu garland him when a female constable stops her and she activates the bomb. Confusion follows after the blast and wires short-circuit due to the impact. A colleague of Haribabu phones Subha Sundaram that Hari is dead due to the blast. Subha asks him to get Hari\'s camera saying it is very important. The riots break out in Chennai city due to Rajiv Gandhi\'s death and a small hotel owner asks Sivarasan and others to leave due to the tension. They all leave in a Maruthi van. The rioters plan to cut up a DMK flag. But a DMK worker (Chandrasekhar) fights them. Ramakrishnan intervenes and the worker recites poetry saying that they are not weak but they follow their party orders since they believe their party as a family. A voiceover of Muthuvel Karunanidhi is heard saying that at this unfortunate time, people may provoke and try to demoralise the party but they must not lose their hope. Arun tries to talk with DGP regarding suspension of officers. A Congress leader asks the DGP to release his party men. The DGP says rowdies and goondas are using this situation so they cannot differentiate between rowdy and party members. Arun asks why they have been suspended the Congress leader says they should be dismissed. Arun loses his cool when the Congress leader says police have chickened out and run, Arun says that since there where no party people and only police, common people died. Arun asks whether they knew of the blast before, he storms out and Ramakrishnan follows him. The DGP asks the leader to go away since politicians and police still have respect.

Karthickeyan arrives in Chennai. He tells the officials that they must not believe in a single path to cracking the case. He also says that the Press can divert them by posting rumours. He visits the assassination site and then later in headquarters and asks Ramakrishnan to develop the film from Haribabu\'s camera. In Thiruthuraipoondi, Shankar gets caught and based on his diary, the officers arrest Nalini\'s mother, brother and finally Nalini and Murugan.
