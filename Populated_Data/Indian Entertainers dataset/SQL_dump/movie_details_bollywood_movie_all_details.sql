As it turns out, the reclusive genius Venkat has cracked a theory that could redefine the principles of probability and randomness.

Although Venkat has no interest in the money that could come from practicing his equation to crack Teen Patti, (a poker game) he eventually succumbs to Shantanu\'s charismatic persuasion.

As a child he witnessed numerous atrocities committed on fellow Indians by their British rulers, who came to trade under the guise of the East India Company, but ended up controlling most of the nation, and permitting tyrants such as General Dyer to massacre thousands of innocent men, women and children in Jallianwala Baug. As a child he was impressed by Mohandas K. Gandhi, especially his call to launch the non-cooperation movement, which led to thousands of people burning British-made clothing, giving up schools, and college studies, and government jobs - only to be let down by Gandhi himself when he called off the movement. Undaunted, Bhagat decided to be a revolutionary, starting with getting into petty fights, then as a grown-up joining the Hindustan Republic Association. When Lala Lajpat Rai was beaten to death by the police, Bhagat, along with Shivram Rajguru, Sukhdev, and others daringly carried out the assassination of a police officer named Saunders, which eventually led to Bhagat\'s arrest, where he was lodged in a cell, tortured and beaten mercilessly. His father, Kishan, paid Rs.60,000/- and bailed him out, so that he could get him to run a diary-farm and get married to a girl from Manavali. But being a revolutionary was in Bhagat\'s blood, and when the British proposed the Trade Disputes and Public Safety Bills, he would initiate the bombing in the Indian Parliament Building, along with Batukeshwar Dutt, be arrested, and tried in an open court. This is where Bhagat launched his much-publicized revolution, and became popular with the masses, especially the younger generation, laborers, and farmers, so much so that his popularity rivaled that of Gandhi himself. Even in prison, Bhagat made headline news when he and other prisoners undertook a 63 day fast unto death to improve the conditions of Indian freedom-fighter prisoners. Then the British re-opened the Saunders\' murder case, which led to death sentences being imposed on Bhagat, Shivram, and Sukhdev. The entire nation rose up in protest, including the Congress party - with the ball being in Gandhi\'s court - for he was due to sign the Irwing Pact, and Indians hoped that he would use this as a bargaining chip to save the lives of the heroic trio. Will Gandhi rise up to the occasion and save the trio - so that they could pave the way for a modern and independent India, not just a country ruled by the British with a dominant status - an India free of communal hatred, injustice, corruption, and fundamentalism, or will Gandhi end up disappointing Bhagat all over again?',155,'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODdhOWU3YjItM2JjYi00ODFkLWJjODgtNTU4ZWM0MTVlZGI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEzNzg0Mjkx.jpg',2002,'Action, Biography, Drama, History','Hindi','Rajkumar Santoshi','Ranjit Kapoor, Piyush Mishra, Anjum Rajabali, Anjum Rajabali, Rajkumar Santoshi','Ravi Sarin, Prakash Talreja, Kumar Sadhuram Taurani, Ramesh Sadhuram Taurani, Renu Taurani, Varsha Taurani','A.R.

Revolver Rani is set in this hostile world where there are no friends; only fragile alliances and deadly enemies that aim straight for the head. But sometimes you do not need to take lives to finish your enemies. Sometimes you just need to go for their heart. Revolver Rani is a satirical and unusual love story set against the backdrop of politics. It\'s about Alka Singh (Kangana Ranaut), the leader of a political party and her obsessive love for Rohan Mehra (Vir Das), a rising star of Bollywood. The elections in Gwalior have just finished and Alka\'s reign has come to an end. Her opposition, the Tomar party, have come into power and want to use their new position to take out Alka, but first, they want to hurt her. The Tomars kidnap Rohan from Mumbai and take him back to Gwalior with the aim to kill him. They are about to pull the trigger when Revolver Rani turns up, all guns blazing and saves his life. Revolver Rani has a very unique story at its heart that has only ever been hinted at before in Bollywood. This film will bring that story into the limelight and show the viewers what would happen if a political giant fell in love with a Bollywood star and then had to protect him from her enemies. It\'s a very authentic satire, littered with dead bodies, love and black comedy that builds up to an iconic climax set in the Shivpuri Bird Sanctuary (Madhya Pradesh) just before the break of dawn.

To the world she is a successful and independent woman, but she\'s actually lonely and lost, a mere puppet in Nikhil\'s hands. Aditya Garewal (Shiney Ahuja) is an aspiring director keen on casting Sana for his debut film, but only on his own terms; he is willing to go to any lengths to get her to agree to the film, even if that means preying on her slight insecurities and her turbulent relationship with Nikhil. Nikhil is successful in casting her in her film, which turns out to be a super hit. But somewhere along the way he realizes that he just can\'t pull away from Sana; he has actually fallen in love with her in spite of his friend Sam (Purab Kohli) reminding him that Sana is just their ladder to success. As the film progresses Aditya realizes that Sana is not just insecure and lonely; she\'s also mentally unbalanced, suffering from acute schizophrenia. She\'s haunted by the imaginary Rani who leads her to believe that everyone is out to kill her. Sana\'s mother and Nikhil get her admitted to the hospital and resort to shock treatment to speed up her recovery so she can return to all her assignments. What follows is Aditya\'s unshakable belief that he can heal Sana; he even gives up his burgeoning career to take her away from the industry and free Sana from all of her mental demons.

The film industry of each country has characteristics peculiar to their culture. That is what distinguishes them, makes them intriguing and anecdotes associated with each industry in a specific cultural context naturally lend themselves to interesting tales. The story of Baby Kusum is such an intriguing and horrifying tale. It is a story about life imitating art in a grotesque and bizarre way. This film seeks to probe into the mechanism that operates behind the creation of dreams. It highlights a phenomenon that was peculiar and exclusive to the Indian film industry--- the practise of casting children in roles opposite to their natural genders. We have had many instances of young girls being cast as boys in films and vice versa. Their screen names used to be changed to suit the gender they were playing on screen. Interestingly, in Raja Harishchandra, the first narrative film made in India, a man portrayed the heroine\'s role. It was a common practice in Indian theatre till the middle half of the last century, to cast men in women\'s roles. In cinema however, verisimilitude was sought to a greater degree and hence the entire persona of the performer had to be changed to suit the screen image. It is difficult to ascertain gender of children by their appearance. Their clothes and hairdos often demarcate them. So the practice of casting perky kids, who could deliver effortless performances, in roles that were not representing their own gender, was widely practiced in Indian films. This film purports to delve into the psyche of one such person who was forced to assume a gender role other than his natural gender and analyses the disastrous consequences that follow and destroy him in his adulthood. Baby Kusum is the story of a boy burdened with a sexual identity not his own. It is about the brutality of a society that imposes superficial gender codes. It is a story of human suffering and about the tragedy of human predicament. The film tries to explore the complex maze of relationships: the Oedipal, the homosexual, the exploitative. It tears that veil of shame that covers the face of this glamorous profession. Truth stares naked at the face of an audience bred on and allured by the sham of this life. Baby Kusum explores various spaces--- the real space, the mind space, the sexual space and the spiritual space. All stand juxtaposed together and often are intermingled to create panoply of gore and blood, of intensity and brutality, of love and shame. Cinematically it confronts the time space continuum. It conjures and jumbles up the time past, the time present and the time operative, all together within the same mental space. It creates a delusion. It provokes and raises several pertinent questions. But it never ignores basic human emotions. That is where it becomes a moral fable, a pious tale. That is where it connects to the common man.',98,'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDZkNTljYjItMTFkNC00ZWE1LTgxNWItM2EzODA3NTcxODU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE5NzE3OTE@.jpg',2010,'Drama','Hindi','Sudipto Chattopadhyay','Sudipto Chattopadhyay, Sudipto Chattopadhyay','Parth Arora, Hanif Chunawala, Sanjay Gupta, Gary Van Shipley','Raju Singh','Somak Mukherjee','Bunty Nagi'),('Shob Charitro Kalponik',6.8,'Indraneel\'s sudden death averts a possible divorce, and takes Radhika on a fantastic inward journey of discovery of her own roots through the language of poetry, and lost love.
