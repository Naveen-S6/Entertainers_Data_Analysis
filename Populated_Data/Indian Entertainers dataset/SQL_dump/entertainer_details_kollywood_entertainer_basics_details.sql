His achievements in 3 fields, namely films, philanthropy and politics were remarkable considering his humble origins in Sri Lanka. Raised in poverty by a widowed single mother, he had nothing more than his good looks when he got his first break in \"Sati Lilavati\", a Tamil film of the late 1930s. In the 1940s and 50s, the Tamil film industry was being transformed by screenwriters like Annadurai, Karunanidhi and others belonging to the Dravidian movement. MGR starred in many of the movies they helped make. Annadurai became his mentor and MGR joined the DMK, Annadurai\'s new Dravidian party. His films made MGR a matinee idol among Tamilians. He also started monetarily helping people in need, sowing the seeds for his reputation as a philanthropist. When Annadurai died as Tamil Nadu\'s chief minister, MGR\'s rival Karunanidhi assumed office. MGR accused him of defalcation and was kicked out of the DMK. In 1977, MGR\'s ADMK (later renamed AIADMK) party was swept into power. In his first term, MGR cleaned up corruption and carried out reforms like having an income limit for backward class people to be eligible for the reserved seats in government colleges and jobs. His reforms proved unpopular, so MGR became another corrupt Indian politician having learned not to rock the boat. Tamil Nadu stagnated during the rest of his reign. Yet his mesmerized legions of fans continued to vote him into power. His death in 1987 created a power vacuum that soon brought his old nemesis, the corrupt Karunanidhi, back into power.

Suriya\'s next film in 2017 is with director Vignesh Shivan for Thaanaa Serndha Koottam, following which he has signed on to feature in a film with director Selvaraghavan for his 36th film.Suriya is married to actress Jyothika, with whom he worked with in as many as seven films. The couple, after being together for several years, got married on 11 September 2006. They have two children, a daughter named Diya (born 10 August 2007) and a son named Dev (born 7 June 2010).In 2008, Suriya began the Agaram Foundation, working to help children who drop out of school early in Tamil Nadu. Suriya revealed that he was inspired to begin the movement as a result of his father\'s own organisation, Sivakumar Educational Trust, which had been operating similar benefits on a smaller scale since the 1980s. With the Ministry of Education in Tamil Nadu, he created a short commercial video outlining child poverty, labour and lack of education, titled Herova? Zerova?. The film was written and produced by Suriya and also starred Vijay, Madhavan and Jyothika. Agaram sponsored 159 underprivileged students in 2010 for their higher education in various disciplines, and has continued to provide free seats and accommodation for pupils. With the firm belief that the educated mind can not only eliminate social evils but also aid in the socio-economic upbringing of society, Agaram Foundation works towards providing appropriate learning opportunities to the rural populace who do not otherwise have access to quality education. Through the foundation, he has also set up a platform for students to participate in workshops and improve communication skills, teamwork, goal setting and leadership. Suriya and his family has also extended help towards the education of Sri Lankan Tamil children on behalf of the Sivakumar Charitable Trust. He is also an active participant in other humanitarian works such as \"Save The Tigers\" campaign, which aids in the protection and preservation of Tigers in India, and \"REACH\", a non-profit that cures TB patients for free using supervised medication programs. The actor celebrates every birthday by doing charity work across Tamil Nadu.::Arvind','Muscular Physique, Punch Dialogue Delivery, Intense Performance, Versatile Acting, Powerful Screen Presence, Friendly Personality','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEyODkwMTUtMWQ2Mi00MTJjLWE2MTAtM2ExMzljNGY0ZTc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjYwMDk5NjE@.jpg'),('Tamannaah Bhatia','1989-12-21','5\' 4\" (1.63 m)','Tammu',NULL,'Tamanna Bhatia is an Indian film actress born in Mumbai, India.

He, whose original name was Vijayaraj, was born on 25th August, at Madurai, Tamilnadu, his parents being Azhagarsamy-Andal. When he was one year old his mother Andal passed away. His parents had three more children. To bring up the one year old baby Vijayakanth and because of the pressure exerted upon Vijayakanth\'s father by all the family members, the latter (Father of Vijayakanth) married one Rukmani as his second wife. This couple gave birth to 7 children. All these members now live together happily in a joint family. From 1st std. to 5th std. Vijayakanth studied at a particular school. He finished his 6th std. at M.C.High School. He pursued his 7th and 8th std. at Devakottai school. He did his 9th std. at a different school. 10th and 11th std. were studied by him at St. Mary\'s school. During that period, Vijayakanth was looking after his father\'s rice-mill business. So he couldn\'t pursue his studies beyond 11th std. Vijayakanth had some close friends then. One notable friend among them was A.Se. Ibrahim Rawther (who\'s even now with Vijayakanth as if his own-brother and has also earned the distinction of being one of the leading film producers in cinefield). All these friends in those days used to gather together near Sena\'s Films, a films distribution company, at Madurai. Marsook, the proprietor-distributor of Sena\'s Films, used to keenly observe the activities of Vijayakanth. One day he asked Vijayakanth whether the latter was interested in acting in films. Out of pressure from his friends, Vijayakanth agreed to act in films. Subsequently he (Vijayakanth) was booked for acting in the film \"Yen Kelvikku Yenna Pathil?\". Yet, after some time, he was dropped from the project on the ground that he was not good at Tamil dialogue delivery. This elicited a great passion within his heart that he took a vow to get into cine acting with renewed efforts and to make his career a rewarding success! With this one objective in mind, he knocked at the doors of each and every film company asking for acting chance. But there was not any positive response. Marsook had then distributed so many films directed by M.A.Kaja! Vijayakanth was introduced to Kaja by Marsook. As a result Vijayakanth was booked in \"Inikkum Ilamai\". This was the first film acted by Vijayakanth. After this, he acted in \"Thooraththu Idi Muzhakkam\", \"Neerottam\" and \"Agal Vilakku\". These films didn\'t bring great success. Yet Vijayakanth too didn\'t lose heart. He waited for good opportunity. \'Vadaloor Combines\' proprietor Chidambaram saw \"Neerottam\" at Krishnaveni theatre, T.Nagar, Chennai. Seeing Vijayakanth in action, he started developing some interest in him as he identified some hopeful, positive traits in his (Viyayakanth\'s) style of acting and personality. He wanted to produce a film by booking Vijayakanth. His wish got materialized through \"Sattam Oru Iruttarai\". In this project too there arose stiff opposition from some quarters protesting against giving the hero chance to Vijayakanth in the film! Yet, overlooking all these objections, the producer stood firm in his decision and made Vijayakanth the hero! S.A.Chandrasekaran directed this film. When, finally, the film got released, it proved to be a grand success! Subsequently Vijayakanth was booked in 18 new films. While he was doing these films, at a specific period, his cinema market started becoming dull again! At this juncture, the film \"Saatchi\" was released. Vijayakanth had done the lead role in it. S.A.Chandrasekaran had directed it. P.S.Veerappa had produced it. This film, in it\'s turn, created a new success record. The following is a popular dialogue written by Kalaignar Karunanidhi: \"Veezhvathu Naamaaga Irunthaalum Vazhvathu Thamizhaaga Irukkattum\".Vijayakanth picked up these words as his heart-loving golden rule. Whenever he addresses any function or releases some press statement or birth day message, he uses to add the words \'Tamil\', \'Tamil\', \'Tamil\' as one of his most ideal slogans. The recent release \"Ulavuththurai\" is his 125th film. Upto this film he hasn\'t so far acted even in a single, other language film. He\'s the only Tamil actor who has achieved this distinction! Though actor Sarathkumar had already acted in films before, his role in \"Pulan Visaranai\" in which he teamed with Vijayakanth proved to be one of the great limelights in his acting career. Vijayakanth introduced Mansoor Alikhan to filmfield through his \"Captain Prabaharan\". He (Vijayakanth) has introduced through his different films, film institute students like R.K.Selvamani, R.Aravintharaj, Ilavarasan and a few others as newface film directors. Many different newface heroines also have got introduced through his films. Though Vijayakanth hasn\'t acted in other language films, each and every film of him has been dubbed into Telugu language and thus has led to huge revenue collection too!::Krishanthan',NULL,'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmNmYTNiNzEtZTlmOC00OGFhLTgyYWMtYWYzZDE5NTUyNjFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjYwMDk5NjE@.jpg'),('Vikram','1966-04-17','5\' 6Â¼\" (1.68 m)','Kenny, Chiyaan Vikram','Make your passion as profession and you don\'t have to work one day in your life','Vikram is an Indian film actor, voice actor and a playback singer.
